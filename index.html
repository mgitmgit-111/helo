              <p>Welcome to the magical land where copying is made easier than getting Wi-Fi in MGIT’s computer labs. This site exists to save your sanity, not your GPA. If you’re here thinking, “Perfect, I’ll just paste this into my assignment and outsmart the system,” congratulations — you’ve officially outsmarted only yourself. Professors at MGIT may look like they’re teaching in 1999, but trust me, they know when you submit “Ctrl+C Ctrl+V engineering.” If you get caught cheating using this website, don’t expect sympathy: your grades will tank, your reputation will nosedive, and your juniors will use you as a case study in “How Not to Pass.” Remember: we built this for convenience, not criminal masterminds. Use it to learn, reference, or survive MGIT’s torture-device labs — not to become the next cautionary tale. Copy smart, or your life will copy MGIT’s Wi-Fi speed: zero.</p>
